ChatGPT and Human Cognitive Functions: A Comparative Study
This project investigates ChatGPT's performance on neuropsychological tests that assess prefrontal functions, comparing its abilities to human cognitive processes. By evaluating ChatGPT's responses on tasks such as deception detection, we examine the model's strengths and limitations in replicating human intelligence, particularly in verbal tasks.

Key Highlights:
Objective: To evaluate ChatGPTâ€™s performance on neuropsychological tasks, including lie detection.
Methodology: Fine-tuned ChatGPT-2 on multiple datasets (personal opinions, autobiographical memories, and future intentions), utilizing stylometric analysis to detect deception.
Findings: ChatGPT-2 showed promising accuracy in detecting deception, with performance varying across datasets. The model performed 12.95% better than the BART model in one scenario.
Tools Used: OpenAI's GPT-2, Stylometry, 5-fold cross-validation.
This research contributes to understanding how large language models like ChatGPT align with or differ from human cognitive abilities, especially in tasks linked to the frontal lobes.
